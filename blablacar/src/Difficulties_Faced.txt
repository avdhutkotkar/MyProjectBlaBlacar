

1. Reading Excel Sheet :- 

Excel sheet's Cell Contains : 08412950036 : if starts with 0 .. if this is what Was entered while Sign Up

Problem in handling integer which Starts with 0..

Current Analysis:
 - getStringCellValue  -- illegal state excption for cell containing other types
 - getRawValue --  returns number without 0 in front... 8412950036
 - getNumbericValue -- returns numberic Value in Double not usable -- 8.412950038E9	
 - toString -- returns Numberic value to String not usable.. 8.412950038E9

while assertion need to check exact entered details entered by user while Sign Up... 
-- Can't find solution yet

2. Wait... as we are implementing Hybrid framework.. creating small methods inside POM library pages
   So if in script implicite wait is defined after calling function that wait is no more applicable
   as method gets called and we have to add wait for every methods....
   Need to check for best appraoch..
